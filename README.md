# Tetris Game

This repository contains a simple Tetris implementation using HTML and JavaScript. The game runs entirely in the browser and requires no additional dependencies.

## Running the Game

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. Use the arrow keys to move pieces:
   - **Left/Right:** Move piece horizontally
   - **Down:** Drop piece faster
   - **Q/W:** Rotate piece
3. Click the **Restart** button to start a new game at any time.

The game keeps score and increases the level every 10 cleared lines, speeding up the drop rate.

No build steps are required; simply clone the repo and open the HTML file.
